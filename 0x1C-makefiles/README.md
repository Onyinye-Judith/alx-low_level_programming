What is a Makefile?

A Makefile is a script written in a special syntax that tells the make tool how to build and compile a program or project. It's a file named "Makefile" (or "makefile") that contains a set of rules and instructions for building and managing a project.

A Makefile typically includes:

- Targets: These are the files or programs to be built or generated.
- Dependencies: These are the files or libraries required to build the targets.
- Commands: These are the actions to be executed to build the targets from the dependencies.

The make tool reads the Makefile and executes the commands to build and update the project. Makefiles are commonly used in software development to automate the process of building, compiling, and linking code, as well as to manage dependencies and libraries.

Makefiles are written in a specific syntax, using keywords like target, dependencies, and commands, to define the rules and instructions for building the project. The make tool interprets these rules and executes the necessary commands to build the project.

Makefiles are often used in conjunction with compilers, linkers, and other development tools to automate the build process, making it easier to manage and maintain complex projects.
