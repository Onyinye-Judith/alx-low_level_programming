A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference or link to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size in memory, and elements can be dynamically added or removed. The last node in the list typically points to null, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists provide efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position, but they may have slower access times for random elements compared to arrays.
