A function pointer in programming is a variable that can store the address of a function. It allows you to call functions indirectly through the pointer, which can be useful in various scenarios, such as implementing callbacks, creating dynamic function dispatch, and building extensible software. Function pointers are commonly used in languages like C and C++ to achieve dynamic behavior in programs.
