In C programming, a preprocessor is a part of the compiler that handles preprocessing directives before the actual compilation of the source code. It processes instructions that begin with the # symbol. Some common preprocessor directives include:#include: Used to include header files in your code.#define: Used to create macros and symbolic constants.#ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, and #endif: Used for conditional compilation.#error and #warning: Used to generate error or warning messages.#pragma: Used for compiler-specific instructions.The preprocessor's primary purpose is to perform text manipulation and substitution in your code before the actual compilation process. This allows for code reuse, conditional compilation, and other preprocessing tasks, making your code more efficient and maintainable.
