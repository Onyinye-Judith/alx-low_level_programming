Dynamic libraries, often referred to as shared libraries, are files containing code and data that multiple programs can use simultaneously. They are loaded into memory when a program starts and can be shared among different processes. This helps in efficient use of resources and allows for updates to the library without recompiling every program that uses it. It's like having a set of tools that various applications can borrow rather than each application having its own copy of those tools.
