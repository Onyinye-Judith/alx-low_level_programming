argc stands for "argument count," and it is a variable in C and C++ programs that holds the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the program's name itself.argv stands for "argument vector" and is an array of strings in C and C++ that contains the actual command-line arguments, with argv[0] typically being the program's name and the subsequent elements containing the arguments passed to the program.Together, argc and argv allow a program to process and work with command-line arguments provided when the program is executed.
